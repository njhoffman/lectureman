Yet few people today are aware of their place in a succession of nomadic warriors who emerged from the Eurasian steppes to seize control of civilizations. In the 36 gripping lectures of The Barbarian Empires of the Steppes, award-winning Professor Kenneth W. Harl of Tulane University guides you through some 6,000 miles and 6,000 years to investigate how these nomadic peoples exerted pressure on sedentary populations, causing a domino effect of displacement and cultural exchange. You\u2019ll discover how a series of groups\u2014from the Sacae and the Sarmatians to the infamous Huns and Mongols\u2014pushed ever westward, coming into contact with the Roman Empire, Han China, and distant cultures from Iraq to India and playing decisive roles in history and paving the way for our globalized world.","course_image":"https:\/\/secureimages.teach12.com\/tgc\/images\/m2\/courses\/high\/3830.jpg","small_tile_image":"https:\/\/secureimages.teach12.com\/tgc\/images\/m2\/courses\/low\/3830.jpg","large_tile_image":"https:\/\/secureimages.teach12.com\/tgc\/images\/m2\/courses\/medium\/3830.jpg","rating":"6.098600","average_rating":4.5,"tag":"","course_type":"course","formats":["instant_audio","digital_transcript","instant_video","dvd","physical_transcript"],"added":"2014-01-14T00:00:00+00:00","type":"individual","url_key":"the-barbarian-empires-of-the-steppes","professor_name":"Kenneth W.

On the contrary, the era was full of fascinating figures and world-altering events.

For an accurate picture of how the political, social, and religious structure of present-day Europe came to be-and even why we're speaking English today-studying the key events between the years 500 to 1500 is of critical import.

Yet very few of us have any idea of how electronic devices actually work. In fact, these increasingly complex devices operate on a few basic principles that are both fascinating and easy to understand. Now, in 24 clear and accessible lectures, award-winning Professor of Physics Richard Wolfson of Middlebury College provides a working explanation of the principles that govern electronic circuits, then shows these principles in action with devices you use every day. By leaving much of the rigorous mathematics to the textbooks, your education in modern electronics will take a practical approach suitable for the aspiring engineer, the enthusiastic tinkerer, or the curious intellectual. Understanding Modern Electronics will demystify the behavior and inner circuitry of electronic devices and inspire you to see technology in a whole new light.","course_image":"https:\/\/secureimages.teach12.com\/tgc\/images\/m2\/courses\/high\/1162.jpg","small_tile_image":"https:\/\/secureimages.teach12.com\/tgc\/images\/m2\/courses\/low\/1162.jpg","large_tile_image":"https:\/\/secureimages.teach12.com\/tgc\/images\/m2\/courses\/medium\/1162.jpg","rating":"5.479500","average_rating":4.4,"tag":"","course_type":"course","formats":["digital_transcript","dvd","instant_video","physical_transcript"],"added":"2014-06-27T00:00:00+00:00","type":"individual","url_key":"understanding-modern-electronics","professor_name":"Richard Wolfson","professor_title":"Ph.D.","attribute_set":"Course","trailer_video_id":"1162","guest_bestsellers":"297","customer_bestsellers":"274","categories":[{"name":"Hobby & Leisure","url":"hobby-leisure","parent":""},{"name":"Hobby","url":"hobby","parent":"Hobby & Leisure"},{"name":"Science","url":"science","parent":""},{"name":"Engineering & Technology","url":"engineering-technology","parent":"Science"},{"name":"Physics & Chemistry","url":"physics-chemistry","parent":"Science"}],"format_details":[{"id":5973,"sku":"DT1162","format":"digital_transcript","format_name":"Digital Transcript","is_transcript":true,"pricing":{"price":15,"final_price":15,"min_price":15,"special_price":15,"priority_price":0,"on_sale":false,"currency":"USD"}},{"id":5974,"sku":"PD1162","format":"dvd","format_name":"DVD","is_transcript":false,"pricing":{"price":269.95,"final_price":269.95,"min_price":269.95,"special_price":269.95,"priority_price":0,"on_sale":false,"currency":"USD"}},{"id":5975,"sku":"DV1162","format":"instant_video","format_name":"Instant Video","is_transcript":false,"pricing":{"price":234.95,"final_price":234.95,"min_price":234.95,"special_price":234.95,"priority_price":0,"on_sale":false,"currency":"USD"}},{"id":5976,"sku":"PT1162","format":"physical_transcript","format_name":"Physical Transcript","is_transcript":true,"pricing":{"price":25,"final_price":25,"min_price":25,"special_price":25,"priority_price":0,"on_sale":false,"currency":"USD"}}],"pricing":{"price":234.95,"final_price":234.95,"min_price":234.95,"special_price":234.95,"priority_price":0,"on_sale":false,"currency":"USD"}},{"relevance":1,"id":158,"title":"Black Holes, Tides, and Curved Spacetime: Understanding Gravity","sku":"1231","short_description":"The force of gravity rules the universe, yet it is one of the least understood of all the forces of nature.
